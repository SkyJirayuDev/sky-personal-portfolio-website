# Getting Started with Next.js 15 and App Router

Next.js 15 introduces powerful new features that make building modern web applications faster and more efficient than ever. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the App Router, React Server Components, and best practices for building production-ready applications.

## What's New in Next.js 15

The latest version of Next.js brings several exciting improvements:

- **Enhanced App Router**: Better performance and developer experience
- **React Server Components**: Improved server-side rendering capabilities
- **Turbopack**: Faster build times and hot reloading
- **Improved TypeScript Support**: Better type inference and error messages

## Setting Up Your Project

Let's start by creating a new Next.js project with TypeScript:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

This command creates a new Next.js project with:

- TypeScript configuration
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- ESLint for code quality
- App Router enabled by default

## Understanding the App Router

The App Router is built on React Server Components and introduces a new file-based routing system:

```
app/
├── layout.tsx          # Root layout
├── page.tsx           # Home page
├── about/
│   └── page.tsx       # About page
└── blog/
    ├── page.tsx       # Blog listing
    └── [slug]/
        └── page.tsx   # Dynamic blog post
```

### Creating Your First Route

Create a new route by adding a `page.tsx` file in a folder:

```typescript
// app/about/page.tsx
export default function AboutPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>Welcome to our about page!</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## React Server Components

Server Components run on the server and can directly access databases, file systems, and other server-side resources:

```typescript
// app/posts/page.tsx
import { getPosts } from '@/lib/posts';

export default async function PostsPage() {
  // This runs on the server
  const posts = await getPosts();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Blog Posts</h1>
      {posts.map(post => (
        <article key={post.id}>
          <h2>{post.title}</h2>
          <p>{post.excerpt}</p>
        </article>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use TypeScript**: Take advantage of type safety and better developer experience
2. **Optimize Images**: Use `next/image` for automatic optimization
3. **Implement Proper SEO**: Use metadata API for better search engine optimization
4. **Follow Performance Guidelines**: Leverage Server Components and static generation

## Conclusion

Next.js 15 with App Router provides a powerful foundation for building modern web applications. The combination of Server Components, improved routing, and enhanced developer experience makes it an excellent choice for your next project.
